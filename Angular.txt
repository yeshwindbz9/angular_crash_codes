What is Angular?
Angular is a JavaScript framework which allows us to create reactive single page applications (SPA's).


Whats it with different versions of Angular?
Angular 1 -> AngularJS
There was a complete rewrite of the framework from Angular 1 to 2.
Angular 2 (2016)
Angular 4
.   (There is a new version every 6 months)
.   (They had small incremental changes)
.   (They are mostly backwards compatible)
Angular 12
Note the remaining versions are the updations of Angular 2.


Whats Angular CLI?
Angular CLI makes it wasy to create applications out of the box that follows industry standards and the best practises.


What are the common angular commands?
npm install -g @angular/CLI
ng new my-dream-applications
cd my-dream-app
ng serve


Whats TypeScript?
TS is a super set of JS, Angular uses TS. It's a strongly typed language.
TS is compiled to JS, thus JS is run the browser. Angular works like a bridge between TS and the browser.


How does an Angular project boot up?
First the src/main.ts file is accessed from the project folder, here the AppModule is passed as an argument to
the bootstrapModule, further in app.module.ts we give AppComponent as a value to the bootstrap property in the NgModule,
then angular analyzes the app components and knows the selector i.e. app-root, thats how angular is able to handle app root in index.html.

Note: Angula is a JS framework which changes the DOM i.e. HTML at runtime.

How to create components via CLI?
ng generate component component-name or ng g c component-name
it creates boiler code for components, i.e. initializes a component folder with files.


What is the template and styles property/string in the component.ts file?
the template property specifies the HTML code, we can either specify the raw html code or the template url by
specifying the path of the component.html file. Specifying the html template in the coomponent.ts file is aka inline.
similarly, we have the styles and styleURLs for the CSS properties that allow us to style and design our html code.


What are selectors?
A selector is used to identify each component uniquely into the component tree, 
and it also defines how the current component is represented in the HTML DOM.
we can specify the selector as an attribute by specifying in the brackets eg. [app-server]
else we can also specify the selector as a class that we can use in different html elements .app-server


What is databinding?
It can be defined as the communication binding between the TS code i.e. business logic and the HTML template.
    String interpolation({ data }), Property binding([property]="data") -> outputs data i.e. TS Code to HTML Tempalte.
    Event binding((event)="expression") -> inputs data or react to users events i.e. HTML Template to TS Code.
    Two Way Binding([(ngModel)]="data") -> combination of both, ip/op.

Note: databinding, especially property and event binding requires us to know the properties or events of the html elements
you can simply google Element_name properties or Element_name events to know more about the events or properties.
Property & Event Binding not only works with HTML elements but it also works for Directives and Components with Native and Custom elements.

Note: npm install bootstrap@next --save is used to install bootstrap 4 in a project.

How to install bootstrap into you Angular project?
This will add bootstrap 4 to your project. -> npm i bootstrap@next --save
Next go to your src/style.css file and import bootstrap there -> @import "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
Finally in angular.json file add path in styles -> "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"


What are directives in Angular?
Directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications. 
E.g. Attribute directivesâ€”directives that change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.

Note:The prefix ng stands for "Angular;" all of the built-in directives that ship with Angular use that prefix.
Similarly, it is recommended that you do not use the ng prefix on your own directives in order to avoid possible name collisions in future versions of Angular.


Whats ngIf?
The ngIf directive removes or recreates a portion of the DOM tree based on an {expression}.
If the expression assigned to ngIf evaluates to a false value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the element is reinserted into the DOM.


Whats ngFor?
ngFor is a predefined directive in Angular. It accepts an array to iterate data over atemplate to replicate the template with different data. 
It's the same as the forEach() method in JavaScript, which also iterates over an array.


Whats ngClass?
The ngClass directive allows you to dynamically set CSS classes on an HTML element by databinding 
an expression that represents all classes to be added.


Whats ngStyle?
An attribute directive that updates styles for the containing HTML element. Sets one or more style properties, 
specified as colon-separated key-value pairs. The key is a style name, with an optional .


How to spot errors in Anular?
Debugging in angular has improved over the years, angular error messages now have standardized error codes, additional details and formatting.
Angular errors are in the following format: NGWXYS: {Error Message}.<link>
    NG WXYZ: NG stands for angular
    NG-W XYZ: W can be 0 or 1-9, where 0 represents Runtime error and codes 1-9 are compiler errors
    NGW-X YZ: X stands for various runtime categories errors from 0-7 as specified below,
    0-Internal, 1-Change Dectection, 2-Dependancy Injection, 3-Template, 4-Styling, 5-Declarations, 6-i18n, 7-Compilation
    NGWX-YZ: YZ stands for indexed code.
    {Error Messages}: gives a brief description of the error
    <link>: gives a link to angular.io/errors which will give guides and tips to debug the error


How to make bindable elements from parent to child?
How to use the data from parent component as an Input to the child component?
How to share data between Components?
Firstly, create a variable to hold the input data in the child component ts file
    @Input('ipElement') element: {ipData: string};
Further, use databinding to send the data from the parent html object,
    [ipElement]="ipElement"
Provided you have the ipElement as an object as an object in parent html object/ ts file.


What is EventEmitter in angular?
Data flows into your component via property bindings and flows out of your component through event bindings. 
If you want your component to notify his parent about something you can use the Output decorator with EventEmitter to create a custom event.


How to create a custom event?
Firstly, import { EventEmitter } from '@angular/core';
Second, create a variable to handle the event by using the Output Directive so that you can pass it to the parent component,
    @Output('eventCreated') anEvent = new EventEmitter<{eventData: string}>();
Then emit the event by a fuction like a click of a button, 
    this.anEvent.emit({eventData: string});

Note: eventCreated is a custom event alias here.

How to listen to a custom event?
Inside the parent html use databinding to listen to the event,
    (eventCreated)="eventCaptured($event)"
Provided you have the evenCaptured function initialized in the parent ts file.


Whats a ViewEncapsulation?
In Angular, component CSS styles are encapsulated into the component's view and don't affect the rest of the application.
Emulated view encapsulation (the default) emulates the behavior of shadow DOM by preprocessing (and renaming) 
the CSS code to effectively scope the CSS to the component's view.
Emulated view encapsulation (the default) emulates the behavior of shadow DOM by preprocessing (and renaming) the

What are local refrences in templates?
A template reference variable is often a reference to a DOM element within a template. 
It can also refer to a directive (which contains a component), an element, TemplateRef, or a web component. 
Use the hash symbol (#) to declare a reference variable.
The refrence variable can only beused in the template and not in the TS file, to use it there pass it in an event or a function.
The refrence variable then can be used as an HTMLElement in the TS file.


What is @ViewChild?
A ViewChild is a component, directive, or element as a part of a template. 
If we want to access a child component, directive, DOM element inside the parent component, we use the decorator @ViewChild() in Angular. 
Since the child component can be located inside the parent component, it can accessed as @ViewChild.

Note: ViewChild and ContentChild are two very important features of Angular. 
It is used to access Child Component in the Parent Component. 
Any directive, component, and element which is part of component template is accessed as ViewChild.

What is @ContentChild?
Use to get the first element or the directive matching the selector from the content DOM. 
If the content DOM changes, and a new child matches the selector, the property will be updated.


What is the difference between ViewChild () and ContentChild ()?
ViewChild is used to select an element from component's template while ContentChild is used to select projected content.


How is <ng-content> used?
The ng-content tag is used for content projection. 
It is basically a placeholder to hold the dynamic content until it is parsed. Once the template is parsed, 
Angular replaces the tag with content.
We can use content projection to create a reusable component. 
The components that have similar logic & layout and can be used in many places in the application. 
Take an example of a card component.


What are the LifeCycles of a Component?
A component instance has a lifecycle that starts when Angular instantiates the component class and 
renders the component view along with its child views.
Different lifecycles of a Component include:-
    ngOnChanges - called after a bound input property changes.
    ngOnInit - called once the component is initialized.
    ngDoCheck - called during every change detection run.
    ngAfterContentInit - called after ng-content has been projected into the view.
    ngAfterContentChecked - called every time the projected content has been checked.
    ngAfterViewInit - called after teh components view and child views has been initialized.
    ngAfterViewChecked - called after teh components view and child views has been checked.
    ngOnDestroy - called once the component is about to be destroyed.


Whats the difference between attribute and structural directives?
Structural directives are used for shaping or reshaping HTML DOM by adding, removing elements. 
They affect the whole area in the DOM i.e. elements get added or removed.
They look like any normal html attribute and have a leading * in front of them.

Attribute directives are used to change the appearance or behavior of DOM element.
they only affect the element by changing it, they too look like an html attribute,
possibily with databinding or event binding.


How to create a custom directive in angular?
We can use the command ng generate directive folder-name/directive-name 
or ng g d directive-name to create a directive, remember to add it into the list of declarations in app module.

We can create custom directives that uses the element reference to change its style or state, but
it is better to use Renderer as it will help us achieve the goal without actually changing the DOM element.


Whats Renderer?
The Renderer2 class is an abstraction provided by Angular in the form of a service that allows to manipulate elements 
of your app without having to touch the DOM directly. By default, Angular renders a template into DOM. You can use custom rendering to intercept 
rendering calls, or to render to something other than DOM.


What is HostListner?
In Angular, the @HostListener() function decorator allows you to handle events of the host element in the directive class.
To do this, you need to handle events raised on the host element in the directive class. 
In Angular, you do this using @HostListener()


What is HostBinding?
It is a decorator that marks a DOM property as a host-binding property and supplies configuration metadata. 
Angular automatically checks host property bindings during change detection, and if a binding changes it updates the host element of the directive.


What are services in angular?
Angular services are singleton objects that get instantiated only once during the lifetime of an application. 
They contain methods that maintain data throughout the life of an application, 
i.e. data does not get refreshed and is available all the time.


How to create a service?
create a new service-name.service.ts file, add this to the providers array in your component or the app module.
if it is added to a custom component then the service has a particular instance for that component, else
adding it to the app module's providers array will give rise to a system wide instance of that service.
Further in the components where you wish to use the service, initialize the constructor with the service object.


Whats is Dependency Injector in Angular?
Dependency injection, or DI, is a design pattern in which a class requests dependencies from external 
sources rather than creating them. Angular's DI framework provides dependencies to a class upon instantiation. 
You can use Angular DI to increase flexibility and modularity in your applications.

Note: We can create a custom service by just making a class and use dependency injection 
by creating an object of this class as a private variable in the constructor of any component.


What are the different Heirarchial injectors?
A hierarchical dependency injection system allows us to define different boundaries or scopes for our 
dependencies to run in and follows the component tree structure. By default, services registered to Angular are 
application wide but we can also create services that are isolated to a subset of components.
    AppModule: Same Instance of Service is avaliable Application-Wide.
    AppComponent: Same instance of Service is avaliable for all components(but not for other services).
    CustomComponent: Same instance is avaliable for the component and all its child components.


Note: We can also inject a service into another service, but the service that takes the injection must have an injectable decorator.
