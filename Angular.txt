How does an Angular project boot up?
First the src/main.ts file is accessed from the project folder, here the AppModule is passed as an argument to
the bootstrapModule, further in app.module.ts we give AppComponent as a value to the bootstrap property in the NgModule,
then angular analyzes the app components and knows the selector i.e. app-root, thats how angular is able to handle app root in index.html.

Note: Angula is a JS framework which changes the DOM i.e. HTML at runtime.

How to create components via CLI?
ng generate component component-name or ng g c component-name
